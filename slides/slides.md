# Hope in the Coming Messiah
## Isaiah 9:2-7

---

The people who walked in darkness </br>
have seen a great light;

those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, </br>
on them has light shone.

[Isaiah 9:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
 
You have multiplied the nation; </br>
you have increased its joy;

they rejoice before you </br>
as with joy at the harvest, </br>
as they are glad when they divide the spoil.

[Isaiah 9:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

---

For the yoke of his burden, </br>
and the staff for his shoulder, </br>
the rod of his oppressor, </br>
you have broken as on the day of Midian.

For every boot of the tramping warrior </br>
in battle tumult </br>
and every garment rolled in blood </br>
will be burned as fuel for the fire.

[Isaiah 9:4-5 (ESV)](# "ref")

---

For to us a child is born, </br>
to us a son is given; </br>
and the government shall be upon his shoulder,

and his name shall be called </br>
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, </br>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

[Isaiah 9:6 (ESV)](# "ref")

---

Of the increase of his government </br>
and of peace there will be no end, </br>
on the throne of David and over his kingdom,

to establish it and to uphold it </br>
with justice and with righteousness </br>
from this time forth and forevermore.

The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

[Isaiah 9:7 (ESV)](# "ref")
